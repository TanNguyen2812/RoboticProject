I used Matlab to simulate Openmanipulator X robot (4 DOF) without any simulink tools. 
In this project I solved several basic problems in robotic: 
1. Forward kinematics
2. Inverse kinematics
3. Compute joint's velocity by Jacobian method and compare with numberical differentiation.
4. Visualize joint's velocity at the singularities.
5. Path plaining: Linear and circular, trapezoid motion profile.
